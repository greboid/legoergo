Simple project to run [ergo](https://github.com/ergochat/ergo) with [certwrapper](https://github.com/csmith/certwrapper) in a container.  Gets you a modern IRCd with an up to date public certificate.

Certwrapper should be configured using environmental variables.

Ergo should get an ircd.yaml and ergo.motd into the /ircd directory
